Standard Python
---------------

Reinteract worksheets use standard Python with just a few additions and limitations

Efficient Operation
-------------------

When you make a change to a Reinteract worksheet, Reinteract is
frequently able to only execute the portion you change rather than the
entire worksheet, which is very useful when operating on large data
sets.

Inline and Sidebar Results
--------------------------

Special result displays can be shown either inline or in a sidebar.

Extensible
----------

You can create your own custom result types.

Full Editor
-----------

The Reinteract editor provides all the features you would expect in a code editor, including syntax-highlighting, completion, and auto-indentation.

Notebooks
---------

You can group your Reinteract worksheet into *notebooks*.
