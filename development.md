Reporting bugs and submitting patches
-------------------------------------

We use [bugzilla.gnome.org](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/browse.cgi?product=reinteract) for bug tracking. Patches should be attached to a bug in `git format-patch` format.

Source code
-----------

Reinteract development is managed using git. For information about checking out the code from the master repository, see the [Download Page](/download.html#Source)

The following links can help you get started using git.

 * The git web site has lots of [documentation](http://git-scm.com/documentation) and links, including the official git tutorial.
 * [Git Tips](https://live.gnome.org/Git/Tips) from the GNOME Website. See in particular the section on git-bz, which is a convenient tool for using Git to submit patches to bugzilla.
 * If you want to publish your own Reinteract Git repository, [github](http://www.github.com) can be a convenient place to do that.

Design Notes
------------

These cover the ideas behind the design of some portions of the Reinteract user interface.
